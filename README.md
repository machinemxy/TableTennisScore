#TableTennisScore#
This app is made because once I play table tennis with friends in some place and at that place there are no scoreboard. Though I download a scoreboard app from app store but it always has advertisement in the button part and if I made a mistake by record the score for a wrong side, I cannot rewind.  So at that time I thought of creating my own table tennis scoreboard app which is clean and the score can be corrected.
You can download it from [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/simple-table-tennis-scoreboard/id1341384517?mt=8) for free.
